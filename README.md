# Rotating-Navigation-with-CSS-and-JavaScript

Created a simple blog with a hamburger navigation icon on the top left.
When you click the navigation icon, the entire page rotates to the left which reveals the hidden navigation items that is in horizontal.
The hamburger navigation icon turns into a close button which you are able to click to turn back to its original orientation.
This code was mostly CSS with added styles but I integrated some JavaScript as well for animation.


Changed the overflow-x to hidden to hide the scroll bar on the x-axis.
Added a transition to rotate the container 20 degrees to the left by 0.5 seconds
